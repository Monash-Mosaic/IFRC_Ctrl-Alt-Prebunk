          "It is certain that human activities have caused the observed and projected changes in climate.",
          "The climate has changed many times in the past before humans began burning coal and oil so it’s a natural occurrence",

      "whyCorrect": "Yes, it is extremely likely that human activities are the dominant cause of climate change.",
      "whyIncorrect": "Climate drivers have both natural and human sources while \"Global warming\" refers to the long-term trend of rising average global temperatures. Renewable energy like solar and wind is now far less expensive than fossil fuels."

          "We know the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is higher than it has been at any time in at least the past 800,000 years.",
          "We need to sustain a high amount of CO2 since trees need them."

      "correctAnswer": "We need to sustain a high amount of CO2 since trees need them.",
      "whyCorrect": "Plants do need carbon dioxide (CO2) but CO2 itself does not cause problems. It's part of the natural global ecosystem. The problem is the surplus quantity of CO2 that’s being produced by us as humans",

          "CO2 doesn’t have any effects on plants growth",

      "correctAnswer": "Pseudoscience",
      "whyCorrect": "This is pseudoscience because it relies on a false baseline. The claim of a population increase cites unreliable, unverified estimates from the 1960s—a period of unregulated hunting with no accurate population data. While some populations later rebounded due to conservation laws, this does not prove an overall historical increase.",
      "whyIncorrect": "This is pseudoscience because it relies on a false baseline. The data isn’t being cherry-picked, and there’s no element of sensationalism or conspiracy theories involved."
